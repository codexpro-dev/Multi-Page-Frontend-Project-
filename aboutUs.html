          <h2>My Bio</h2>
          <p>
            I’m a passionate learner who enjoys exploring technology and
            creative problem-solving. My journey began with curiosity about how
            things work, and over time it has evolved into a love for building
            meaningful digital experiences.

          <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
          <p>
            My goal in this program is to strengthen my coding skills, improve
            my understanding of software design principles, and build projects
            that have real-world impact. I also hope to collaborate and learn
            from other motivated individuals.

          <p>
            I sometimes struggle with imposter syndrome and overanalyzing my
            work. Additionally, I’m working on improving my confidence in public
            speaking and explaining technical concepts clearly to non-technical
            audiences.

          <p>
            Remember how far you’ve come and never stop learning. Challenges
            will always exist, but they’re proof that you’re growing. Keep
            building, stay curious, and don’t be afraid to share your knowledge
            with others.

          <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve realized that growth happens when you step outside your comfort
            zone. Every small effort compounds into big progress — so keep
            showing up, even on hard days.
