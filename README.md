### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Notes for Testing

* **Testing Hooks:** The entire component structure is instrumented with unique **`data-testid`** attributes on every visual element. This allows for stable, reliable end-to-end testing against the UI.
* **External Linking:** All social media links utilize **`target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"`** for security and user experience when navigating to external sites.
* **Time Data Format:** The element displaying the time produces a large integer value, matching the exact millisecond output of JavaScript's `Date.now()`.
